# Timeseries-Analysis - Attriton Forecasting using only Attrition Data

A specific line of business has been seeing a lot of attrition in the last couple of years. The average attrition is around 34% the for last 3 years which is way above the industry average. Time and again, it has struggled with managing a healthy attrition rate. As a result, there has been a constant occurrence of missed SLAs resulting in huge penalties. This has adversely affected customer feedback and employee morale as well. In extreme cases, the contracts were not renewed. High attrition is also a very expensive affair for a company. 

For managers, managing workload has become extremely tedious in the current context. This has been always highlighted in every Quarterly Business Review. Management has also accepted this fact, but the challenge still remains as there have been no improvements noticed in last 12 months. With the constant change in management, the focus kept shifting from one approach to another. 

The aim of this study is to forecast attrition using time series analysis at various levels based on only the attrition data available for the last 14 months. 

The proposed solution is to compare various Time Series Forecasting techniques like ARIMA, Seasonal ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Holt-Winters, Moving Average, Ratio to Moving Average, based on Attrition Date of last 12 months at Enterprise level and drill-down by top contracts with further drill-down by employee levels, pay range & locations. The forecasted data will then be compared with the following 2 months attrition data to arrive at the best possible solution.

Whatâ€™s unique about this study is the use of timeseries forecasting technique to identify future attrition trends based on only attrition data. This forecasted data can be used to better workload management which will in turn reduce missed SLAs and penalties.
